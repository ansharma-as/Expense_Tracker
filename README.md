### Bonus Feature: Budget Warning System üéØ

I implemented a **Monthly Budget Tracker** with intelligent warnings:

- **Budget Status Display**:
  - Shows remaining budget in real-time
  - Color-coded status (green, orange, red)
  - Calculates only current month expenses

  - **Over Budget Alert**: Red alert when budget is exceeded
  - Alerts appear at the top of the page with smooth animations
- **Persistent Storage**: Budget settings saved in localStorage

## üìö Cursor Usage Documentation

### Interesting Prompts Used with Cursor

1. **Initial Structure**
   ```
   "Create a responsive HTML structure for an expense tracker with sections for:
   statistics dashboard, add expense form with fields (amount, category, date, description),
   filters section, expense list, and category breakdown. Include proper semantic HTML."
   ```
   - **Result**: Generated the complete HTML skeleton with proper semantic structure
   - **Modification**: Added budget section and adjusted grid layout for better mobile responsiveness

2. **LocalStorage Integration**
   ```
   "Write JavaScript functions to manage expenses using localStorage with the following
   operations: save expense array, retrieve expenses, add new expense with validation
   (positive amount, no future dates), and delete expense by ID"
   ```
   - **Result**: Created robust localStorage functions with proper JSON serialization
   - **Modification**: Added timestamp field and improved error handling with user notifications

3. **Dynamic Filtering**
   ```
   "Implement a filtering system that allows users to filter expenses by category AND date
   range simultaneously, with a clear filters function that resets everything"
   ```
   - **Result**: Generated filter functions with multiple criteria support
   - **Modification**: Added real-time filter application using event listeners instead of button clicks

4. **Visual Category Breakdown**
   ```
   "Create a category spending breakdown with visual bar charts showing percentage of total
   spending for each category, sorted by highest spending first"
   ```
   - **Result**: Generated percentage calculations and basic bar chart HTML
   - **Modification**: Enhanced styling with gradient bars and improved responsive layout

5. **Budget Warning System**
   ```
   "Implement a monthly budget feature that tracks only current month expenses, shows
   remaining budget, and displays color-coded warnings when 80% used or over budget"
   ```
   - **Result**: Created budget calculation logic and basic warning system
   - **Modification**: Added animated alerts, improved color scheme, and monthly calculation filter

### How Cursor Helped Solve Challenges

1. **Challenge**: Date validation to prevent future dates
   - **Cursor Solution**: Suggested using `setAttribute('max', today)` on date input
   - **Learning**: HTML5 date inputs have built-in max/min attributes for validation

2. **Challenge**: Calculating monthly spending for budget feature
   - **Cursor Solution**: Provided filter logic using `getMonth()` and `getFullYear()`
   - **Modification**: Added to separate function for reusability

3. **Challenge**: Creating smooth notification animations
   - **Cursor Solution**: Generated CSS keyframe animations and timeout logic
   - **Enhancement**: Added slide-in/slide-out animations and auto-dismiss

4. **Challenge**: Responsive grid layout for expense items
   - **Cursor Solution**: Suggested CSS Grid with `grid-template-columns: auto 1fr auto auto`
   - **Learning**: Discovered how Grid's auto and fr units work together for flexible layouts

## üéØ Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. Data Persistence Across Sessions
- **Challenge**: Ensuring expenses and budget settings persist after browser refresh
- **Solution**: Used localStorage with JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Learning**: Implemented try-catch blocks for localStorage access (handles private browsing mode)

### 2. Filter Combination Logic
- **Challenge**: Making category and date range filters work together seamlessly
- **Solution**: Applied filters sequentially by chaining array filter methods
- **Code Quality**: Created reusable `applyFilters()` function called on any filter change

### 3. Responsive Design
- **Challenge**: Making the app usable on mobile devices
- **Solution**: Used CSS Grid with `auto-fit` and media queries
- **Testing**: Added breakpoints at 768px and 480px for tablet and mobile

### 4. Budget Calculation Accuracy
- **Challenge**: Calculating only current month expenses for budget tracking
- **Solution**: Filter expenses by matching month and year before summing
- **Edge Case**: Handles month transitions correctly

### 5. User Experience
- **Challenge**: Providing feedback for user actions
- **Solution**: Implemented notification system with success/error messages
- **Enhancement**: Added confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure with form validation
- **CSS3**: Grid, Flexbox, animations, gradients, media queries
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Arrow functions, template literals, array methods
- **LocalStorage API**: Data persistence

### Code Organization
- **Modular Functions**: Separate functions for each feature
- **Event-Driven**: Event listeners for form submission and filter changes
- **DRY Principle**: Reusable functions like `getExpenses()`, `saveExpenses()`
- **Clear Naming**: Descriptive variable and function names

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "1696789234567",           // Timestamp-based unique ID
  amount: 450.50,                // Number (validated positive)
  category: "Food",              // String (predefined categories)
  date: "2025-10-05",           // ISO date string
  description: "Lunch at cafe", // String (optional)
  timestamp: "2025-10-05T14:30:00.000Z" // ISO timestamp
}
```
